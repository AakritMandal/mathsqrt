    <h1>Square Root</h1>
   <h2>What is Square Root</h2>
   <p>The square root of a number is the factor that we can multiply by itself to get that number. <br> The symbol for square root is \sqrt{ } ​square root of, end square root .<br> Finding the square root of a number is the opposite of squaring a number.</p>
   <h2>How to find Square Root?</h2>
   <ol>
    <li>Repeated Subtraction Method of Square Root</li>
     <p>This is a very simple method. We subtract the consecutive odd numbers from the number for which we are finding the square root, till we reach 0. <br> The number of times we subtract is the square root of the given number. This method works only for perfect square numbers. <br> Let us find the square root of 16 using this method.</p>
       <ul class="tyt">
         <li>16-1 = 15</li>
         <li>15-3 = 12</li>
         <li>12-5 = 7</li>
         <li>7-7 = 0</li>
       </ul>
         <p>You can observe that we have subtracted 4 times. Thus,√16 = 4 </p>
